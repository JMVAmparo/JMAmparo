        <h2>About Alan Turing</h2>
        <p>
          Alan Turing was a pioneering English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
          He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, Turing played a crucial role
          in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
          He created the Turing Machine concept — a theoretical device that formalized the concept of computation. He also laid the groundwork for modern computing 
          and artificial intelligence before his untimely death in 1954.
